## Project Description

Violet 100% free open-source email security solution helping you to protect your mail server against all email threats from the moment they emerge. The flexible architecture combined with the userfriendly, web-based management interface, allows IT professionals and businesses to control all incoming and outgoing emails with ease, and to protect their users from spam, viruses, phishing and trojans.

Violet uses artificial intelligence trained on billions of data points to effectively detect all attacks and blocks them even before it reaches the end users.

## Project Problem

As an experienced cyber security specialist, I know how damaging cyber crime can be. As the most common form of cyber crime, phishing affects both individuals and businesses. Phishing is the most common form of cyber crime, with an estimated 3.4 billion spam emails sent every day.

More than 50% of IT decision makers state that phishing attacks represent a top security concern. Weaknesses in security policies, processes and infrastructure enable phishing threats to reach end users, along with ineffectual trainings intended to instill cyber security awareness in employees.

## Phishing attack statistics

- Roughly 15 billion spam emails make their way across the internet everyday, which means that spam filters are “working overtime” and are liable to permit malicious phishing attack emails to slip through.

- In 2021, 83% of organizations reported experiencing phishing attacks. In 2022, an additional six billion attacks are expected to occur.

- Thirty-percent of phishing emails are opened. This increases the probability of an individual unintentionally clicking on a malicious link or downloading a compelling-looking document that’s laced with malware.

- Forty-two percent of workers self-reported having taken a dangerous action (clicked on an unknown link, downloaded a file, or exposed personal data) while online, failing to follow phishing prevention best practices.

- One in 99 emails is a phishing attack. If a ~1% attack rate doesn’t scare you, the fact that 25% of these emails manage to make their way into Office 365 inboxes just might. Office 365 represents one of the most commonly used email clients, with 60 million commercial users, and 50,000 small business customers worldwide.

- Roughly 90% of data breaches occur on account of phishing. According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, phishing attacks may increase by as much as 400% year-over-year.

- Roughly 65% of cyber attackers have leveraged spear phishing emails as a primary attack vector.

- When asked about the impact of successful phishing attacks, 60% of security leaders stated that their organization lost data, 52% experienced credential compromise, and 47% of organizations contended with ransomware.

- When it comes to phishing attack remediation, IBM’s 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report found phishing to be the second most expensive attack vector to contend with, costing organizations an average of $4.65 million.

- In more eye-opening phishing attack statistics, although 93% of organizations measure the cost of phishing attacks in some way, only 60% of such organizations offer formal cyber security education to their users.

- In relation to phishing, the most heavily targeted sectors have historically included financial institutions, social media enterprises, SaaS/webmail services, and retail vendors.

- Starting in 2016, cyber attackers staged malware and conducted spear phishing attacks in order to gain remote access into the US energy sector’s systems. After gaining access, nation-state threat actors managed to move laterally and to collect information pertaining to Industrial Control Systems.

- According to the Swiss Cyber Institute, LinkedIn phishing messages represent 47% of all social media phishing attempts.

Phishing emails are more pervasive than ever before and threat actors are growing increasingly ruthless. Numerous methodologies for phishing prevention exist. Many organizations could do more to prevent phishing and to reduce associated costs. What else can your company do?
